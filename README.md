# MoonboardGrader

## Overview

Bouldering is a physically demanding sport, that relies on the categorization of climbing routes into various difficulty levels. However, the process of grading rock climbing routes is inherently subjective and can vary significantly based on factors such as the climber's experience, the specific climbing holds, and routes. This subjectivity poses challenges for route setters aiming to accurately convey the nature of the climb to the climbing community. 

One tool which removes some variability of the sport's factors is The Moonboard (https://www.moonboard.com) training device. The Moonboard can provide a standardized framework to evaluate the multifaceted aspects that contribute to a route's difficulty. Factors such as hold types, overhang angles, and route length can be quantified and integrated into a comprehensive equation.The standardized holds aid in creating a large dataset which can be used for analysis.

This program can be used to mathematically calculate a route on the Moonboard Masters 2019 hold set. The challenge I faced with this project involves the redesign of the Moonboard website, now focussing on an app-first approach. The limited data that is provided on the Moonboard website affects the training data size and causes some inaccuracies in unrealistic problems.
